# DevTour

DevTour is a cross-editor workflow guide that keeps the logic of a project documented inside the editor. Every checkpoint (file + line + description) lives in `.devtour/devtour.json`, so VS Code and IntelliJ share the exact same tour files.

## What’s inside?
- `vscode/`: the original VS Code extension (Explorer view, gutter markers, commands and shortcuts).
- `intellij/`: the IntelliJ plugin with a tool window, actions, and notifications comparable to the VS Code experience.

Each sub-project contains its own detailed README with installation, build, and usage notes. Use this root README as a quick map of the repo’s structure and the shared DevTour concept.
